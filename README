My code and the iris data set are in the <code> directory. The code needs to be executed from this directory.

The executable is <k3.py> and can be run with:
<python2.6 k3.py>

Within the main section of the code you can run functions from <demo1>--<demo5> which evaluate different parts of this assignment.

The output from running my program is in the <data> directory.
And my graphs are stored as PNGs in the <graphs> directory.
